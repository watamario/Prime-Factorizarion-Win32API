# Prime Factorization Software Ver. 2 beta2 Source Code for BCC Developer
This source code is for **Windows PC**.

# Requirements
This project has been created by **BCC Developer**, and I use **Borland C++ Compiler 5.5** as a compiler.

This compiler is quite old and supports Windows XP and older, and can't compile 64-bit applications.

# Notes
The source code is "**1.cpp**," the resource script is "**resource.rc**," and the icon is "**app.ico**." You can edit and build by opening "**PrimeFactorization.bdp**" if you use BCC Developer. To avoid errors, don't put this folder on a path that includes other than English characters like Japanese characters.

The executable binary file will be generated as "**PF_IA-32(OlderWindows).exe**" in the "**Debug**" folder for debug builds, and the "**Release**" folder for release builds.
